		<h1>Deprecation notice of Andrew Yu's GitHub account</h1>
		<p>Hello, there.  You have reached the GitHub pages page on my my GitHub account.</p>
		<p>I no longer trust GitHub with my code (or other types of data), because of policy changes, its affiliation (ownership) with Microsoft, and its requirement for proprietary JavaScript.  In order to see my projects, please visit my server's projects directory.  Some of my more important projects are also on my Notabug.</p>
		<p>If you find any links to be broken, or if you find links elsewhere that link to my GitHub, please report them to me via the contact information on my website.  Thank you.</p>
